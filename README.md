# Analyze-Data-Using-SQL
In this project, I analyzed the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store.

The DataBase used in this project is uploaded in two versions (for Mac and for Windows)

I wrote a SQL query to pull the data needed to successfully answer on the questions.

I used the pulled data to build a visual (bar chart, histogram, or another plot) to make the found insights easier to present.

### Presentation includes:
- Four slides
- One visualization per slide
- A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide
- The SQL query used to create the data used in the visualization.
